/**
 * An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly.
 * An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.
 *
 * The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects.
 * It's usually implemented once the application is designed.
 *
 * Consider a scenario in which there is an app that's developed in the US which returns the top speed of luxury cars in miles per hour (MPH).
 * Now we need to use the same app for our client in the UK that wants the same results but in kilometers per hour (km/h).
